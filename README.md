# Project Description:

"Once_Upon_A_Time" is a creative, collaborative writing platform where users can launch and expand community-driven stories. Users kick off a story on the "create" page by setting a title and writing an initial entry of any length. To contribute to a story, users access the "contribute" page, where they’re shown only the latest entry added by another writer before they make their own addition. After contributing, users can no longer edit that story but can read the entire tale on a "view" page. Each user’s dashboard keeps track of the stories they've participated in, while the "collection" page provides a full list of available stories, with filters to sort by factors like recent updates, personal contributions, and more.
